This program uses data from Deutsche Bahn live station board (Bahnhofstafel) API for arrivals and departures of trains
to create a _Gleisbelegungsplan_ (showing graphically when and how long platforms are occupied by trains).

To build the code, you need to also fetch https://github.com/matey-jack/public-transport-enabler and run ```gradle install```
on that project.

This project simply starts with ```sbt run```.
